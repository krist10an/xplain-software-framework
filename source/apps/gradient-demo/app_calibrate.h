 *
 * \brief This application performs touch screen calibration by utilizing the
 * \ref touch_driver_group "Touch driver" and
 * \ref workqueue_group "Workqueue system".
 *
 * The application draws three circles on the screen in sequence as the user
 * touches them. The raw sample data from the touches are used to compute a
 * calibration matrix for the touch driver, enabling it to compute the pixel
 * coordinates of touch events.
